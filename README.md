# Exercice 1

A command that displays “Hello Gaia”

# Exercice 2

A FUNCTION that when called displays “Hello Gaia” (your code should contain both the function and your calling of it)

# Exercice 3

A function that takes 1 string parameter and returns ⁠ Hello ⁠ and then the value of the parameter.

Exemple: if the function is called ⁠ hello ⁠, running ⁠ hello(“Boris”) ⁠ would return ⁠ hello Boris ⁠ (with a space before)

# Exercice 4

A function that takes 2 numbers and do the sum of them and display the result in the console

Exemple: if the function is called ⁠ sum ⁠, running ⁠ sum(1, 2) ⁠ would print ⁠ 1 + 2 = 3 ⁠ in the console

# Exercice 5

A function that takes 2 numbers and that RETURNS the sum of these 2 numbers. Then the code calling the function should display the result (slight variation from ex. 4)

Exemple: if the function is called ⁠ sum ⁠, running ⁠ sum(1,2) ⁠ would RETURN 3 and the calling code would print ⁠ 1 + 2 = 3 ⁠

# Exercice 6 First steps into arrays and loops

Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of its elements.

Call that function ⁠ sum ⁠ and call it with a few arrays of different length such as
⁠ sum([1,2]) ⁠
⁠ sum([1,2,3]) ⁠
⁠ sum([1,2,3,4]) ⁠

Your function should work with array of any size

# Exercice 7 First steps into error handling

Using the same ⁠ sum() ⁠ function as exercice 6, add the below calls and find a way to make your code return -1

⁠ sum(null) ⁠ => should return -1
⁠ sum(undefined) ⁠ => should return -1
⁠ sum([]) ⁠ => should return -1
